To connect to Vayu and get your API credentials, follow these steps:

1. Log into Vayu at [http://app.withvayu.com](http://app.withvayu.com)
2. Navigate to the Integrations section
3. Click "Connect" on the Vayu card

A side pane will open with two important fields:

1. **Client ID** - This is used to identify your organization when making requests to Vayu
2. **Fetch your API token** - This is used to authenticate you when making requests to Vayu

## Important Notes

- Once you generate the API token, make sure to click the copy button as it will not be visible to you in the future after closing the pane
- You can only have one active API token at a time
- To refresh your API token:
  1. First revoke the existing token (from the same place you generated it)
  2. Then click generate again to create a new token 

## Using Your Credentials

### With the Vayu SDK

When using the Vayu SDK:
1. Set your client ID as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export VAYU_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   ```
2. Pass your API token when initializing the Vayu client

For more details about using the SDK, see the [SDK section](/api-reference/pages/sdk).

### Direct API Usage

When making direct API calls without the SDK:
- Include your client ID in the request headers:
  ```
  x-api-key: your_client_id_here
  ```
- When using the API for login, you can read about the login request payload in the [login endpoint documentation](/api-reference/endpoints/auth/login-by-obtaining-a-new-access-token)

Make sure to keep your client ID and API token secure and never expose them in client-side code.
