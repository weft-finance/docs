## Webhook Security

For security purposes, all webhook requests include:
- A timestamp header
- The event type in the payload

Note: Only HTTPS endpoints are supported. HTTP endpoints are not allowed for security reasons.

Make sure to implement proper security measures for your webhook endpoints.

## Best Practices

1. Always verify webhook signatures
2. Implement retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
3. Keep your webhook endpoints secure and up-to-date
4. Monitor webhook delivery status
5. Handle duplicate webhook deliveries gracefully

## Troubleshooting

If you're not receiving webhooks:
1. Verify your webhook URL is accessible from the internet
2. Check that your endpoint returns a 2xx status code
3. Ensure your webhook subscription is active
4. Verify your webhook endpoint can handle the expected payload size
