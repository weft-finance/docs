The Customer Portal provides a secure and streamlined way for customers to access their invoices in one place. Instead of managing multiple emails or logins, customers receive a single-use, one-time access key that grants them entry to their personalized portal. Within the portal, customers can:

- View all issued invoices associated with their account.
- Check invoice status, including paid, pending, or overdue.
- See due dates to stay informed about upcoming payments.
- View and download invoices in a structured, easy-to-access format.
