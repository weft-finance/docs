Vayu specializes in unifying contract commercials and usage data into a single revenue management platform. QuickBooks offers a powerful way for businesses to handle key financial and operational tasks, including accounting and financial management. Integrating the two platforms ensures that your billing and revenue information is fully up to date and aligned at all times, no matter where you’re accessing it. 

Vayu integrates smoothly and swiftly with QuickBooks, offering robust two-way synchronization for your billing and revenue workflows. Not only do you achieve data consistency across platforms, you can also seamlessly automate critical finance operations.

## **Capabilities**

The Vayu-QuickBooks integration tracks failed syncs, catalogs errors, and monitors retries. On top of this, there is duplication prevention when it comes to retries, matching records by unique IDs to avoid conflicts.

The Vayu-QuickBooks integration supports two-way syncs, with certain data syncing from Vayu and other information from QuickBooks.

You are given multiple options for syncing with the integration. 

You can opt for Manual Sync on a per-invoice basis, Bulk Sync for multiple-invoice approval in a single batch, and two different options for Auto Sync. You can implement _Auto Sync by Invoice Issue Date_ or _Auto Sync on Approval_.

### **Logs and Activity Tracking**

Vayu ensures proper versioning and reconciliation by logging all synced records with timestamps for audits. 

To do this, be sure to enable syncing on validation reports. 

All sync activity is tracked inside Vayu:

- Success and failure logs for failed syncs
- Retry attempts
- IDs of created QuickBooks transactions
- Timestamped event history
- Error reasoning/details with user-friendly explanations

These logs help finance teams quickly diagnose and correct issues.

Additionally, QuickBooks accountants use the same API under the accountant role, but with multi-client and permission nuances. 

### **Refunds**

Refunds are handled by Credit Memo and Payment reversal.

## **Quickbooks Accounting User as client**

QuickBooks accountants use the same API under the accountant role, but with multi-client and permission nuances. 

Similarly, this is managed by token access and OAuth 2.0 authentication.
