# **Salesforce**

The Salesforce integration connects Salesforce CRM data with Vayu’s revenue and billing workflows.

It enables Vayu to ingest customer and deal context from Salesforce and use that data to drive pricing, invoicing, and revenue execution.

Salesforce remains the system of record for CRM entities such as accounts and opportunities.

Vayu serves as the system of record for monetization, billing logic, and revenue workflows.

This integration is designed for teams that manage customers and commercial agreements in Salesforce and require a consistent, auditable path from closed deals to billing activity.

## **Synced Data and System Ownership**

Vayu syncs account and deal-related data from Salesforce and associates it with customers, products, and pricing logic inside Vayu.

Salesforce is authoritative for account identity, opportunity structure, and CRM-managed fields.

Vayu does not write back to Salesforce and does not attempt to replicate CRM functionality.

Only data required to support revenue workflows is ingested, and Salesforce record identifiers are preserved for traceability.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

- User must have **Salesforce admin-level access:**
  1. Managed package installation
  2. Permission grants

Installation is via the Salesforce managed package, done through a direct link that you will get during onboarding (and is not individualized).

First, open the install link (you have the option to use a custom domain).

Choose the scope of the installation, as in installing for a general user or an admin.

## **Setup and Authentication**

The integration is configured from within the Vayu platform.

The Salesforce integration is enabled by installing a Salesforce managed package and completing initial configuration in Vayu. 

<Note>
  Authentication is handled natively within Salesforce and _does not_ require OAuth credentials.
</Note>

Unlike other integrations in Vayu, setup is done through the Salesforce sign-in screen and a Custom Domain.

Admins can get this custom domain by logging into Salesforce, then clicking on **Settings**.

Search for “domain,” then navigate down to **Company Settings** and select “My Domain.”

Once there, copy the **Current My Domain URL**, as seen above.

Next, navigate to the Salesforce login screen. Once there, choose to log in via Use Custom Domain in the bottom right corner of the window.

Then, paste your Custom Domain URL from Salesforce. Hit **Continue**.

Next, you will decide the level of access you want to provide from three choices:

- Install for Admins Only
- Install for All Users
- Install for Specific Profiles

Choose the appropriate option and check the box to acknowledge you are installing a “Non-Salesforce Application.”

Press **Install**,.

Next, a final **Approve Third-Party Access** box will appear. There, you will have the _option_ to select **SSL Encryption**.

Finally, select the checkbox next to “**Yes, grant access to these third-party websites**” and press **Continue**.

You will be able to see Vayu included on a list of installed packages.

An administrator connects a Salesforce account and grants access to the Salesforce objects required for account and deal ingestion.

Authentication establishes a secure connection between Salesforce and Vayu.

Once authentication is complete, Vayu immediately begins ingesting eligible records.
