## A

**Auto-upgrade** – Automatically moving a customer to a higher tier or plan when usage or seats exceed a defined threshold, aligning price with consumption.

## B

**Base Fee** – A minimum charge applied to a usage product when consumption is zero or below a set floor.

**Billing Interval** – How often charges are billed (e.g., monthly, quarterly); it can differ from the metering window.

**Bulk Fee** – A pricing option where a single rate applies to all units within a defined volume band.

## C

**Commitment** – The included usage (in units or amount) a customer is entitled to during the plan; charges begin _only_ after the threshold is crossed.

**Credit** – A return of money to the customer, usually in cash or back to their payment method.

## D

**Discount** – A price reduction applied at the line-item or plan level

## F

**Flat Fee (Usage)** – A fixed recurring amount applied to a usage product regardless of consumption.

**Fixed Fees** – Charges not based on metered consumption

## M

**Meter Reset** – The interval at which metered usage counters reaggregate (e.g., monthly), independent of billing cadence.

**Metered Billing** – Billing based on measured usage that Vayu meters and prices according to the plan’s rules.

**Metering Window** – The period over which usage is accumulated for pricing (e.g., monthly for tiered, lifetime for volume).

## O

**Overage** – Usage beyond the commitment that is billed at the specified overage rates and can trigger alerts.

## P

**Platform Fee** – A fixed recurring subscription (often monthly) that grants platform access and can include entitlements.

**Price List** – The plan’s table of charge lines (one-time, subscription, and usage items), their schedules, and rates.

**Prepay (custom interval)** – Collecting payment at the start of a chosen period (e.g., monthly, quarterly, custom) for the upcoming service

**Pro rata** (a.k.a. **Proration**) – Charging only for the portion of a billing period used when a plan starts, changes, or ends mid-cycle, typically proportional to days or units. 

## R

**Revenue Share** – A usage model that charges a percentage of reported revenue for the period.

**Rollover overage** – Carrying excess usage from one period to be billed on the subsequent invoice instead of the current one

## T

**Tiered Pricing** – Unit price changes by tiers within each metering window; units in a higher tier are billed at that tier’s rate.

## U

\*\*Usage Fee \*\*- A one-time fee that covers metered usage, meter resets, and commitments or overages. (Tiered, Volume, Revenue share)

**Usage Product** – A line item whose cost is calculated from measured consumption rather than a fixed amount.

## V

**Volume Pricing** – The unit price is based on total lifetime usage since contract start, not just the current period.
