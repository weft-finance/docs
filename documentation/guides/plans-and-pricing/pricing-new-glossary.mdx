## A

**Auto-Upgrade** – When a customer crosses a usage tier into a new tier, that customer is automatically upgraded to the new tier permanently

## B

**Base Fee** – A minimum charge applied to a usage product when consumption or below a set floor (even if there is no consumption at all)

**Billing Interval** – How often charges are billed (e.g., monthly, quarterly); it can differ from the metering window.

**Bulk Fee** – A pricing option where a single rate applies to a set volume of units

## C

**Commitment** – The included usage (in units or amount) a customer is entitled to during the plan; charges begin _only_ after the threshold is crossed.

**Contract** – The agreement defining the customer’s plan, pricing, terms, and duration. In Vayu, the contract anchors the price list, metering windows, commitments, and billing behavior.

- **Contract Start Date** – The date the contract’s terms take effect
- **Contract Signature Date** – The date the contract is signed by the customer
- **Contract Term** – The period during which the contract is active

**Credit** – A return of money to the customer, usually in cash or back to their payment method.

## D

**Discount** – A price reduction applied at the line-item or plan level (can be a One-Time Discount or a Recurring Discount)

## F

**Flat Fee (Usage)** – A fixed recurring amount within a specific tier applied to a usage product regardless of consumption

**Fixed Fees** – Charges not based on metered consumption

## M

**Meter Reset** – The cadence at which metered usage counters reaggregate (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually), independent of billing interval.

## O

**One-Time Discount** – A discount applied for one billing cycle, as opposed to a Recurring Discount

**One-Time Fee** – A single, non-recurring charge applied once to begin using a product

**Overage** – Usage beyond the commitment

## P

**Price List** – The plan’s table of charge lines (one-time, subscription, and usage items), their schedules, and rates.

**Prepay** – Collecting payment at the start of a chosen period for the upcoming service

**Pro rata** (a.k.a. **Proration**) – Charging only for the portion of a billing period used when a plan starts, changes, or ends mid-cycle, typically proportional to days or units.

**Product** – An item defined in the price list, represented as a fixed fee, usage product, one-time fee, or platform fee. Billing behavior depends on its product type and associated metering

## R

**Recurring Discount** – A discount that is permanently applied to every billing cycle going forward, as opposed to a One-Time Discount

**Revenue Share** – A usage model that charges a percentage of rep for the period.

**Rollover Overage** – Carrying excess usage from one period to be billed on the subsequent invoice instead of the current one

## T

**Tiered Pricing** – Unit price changes by tiers within each metering window; units in a higher tier are billed at that tier’s rate.

## U

**Usage-Based Fee** – A fee that covers metered usage, meter resets, and commitments or overages. (Tiered, Volume, Revenue share)

**Usage Product** – A line item whose cost is calculated from measured consumption rather than a fixed amount.

## V

**Volume Pricing** – The unit price is adjusted (discounted) based on higher usage, with customers paying the percentage and base fee of their current tier
