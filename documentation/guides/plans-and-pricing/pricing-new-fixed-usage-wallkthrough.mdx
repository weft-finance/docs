# Pricing Overview

Vayu supports two general payment models: fixed fees and usage fees. Each model has multiple options, as we will describe below. There are standard or default options baked into many of these plans, which can be adapted based on customer needs. Click on any option to see a more detailed description:

| **Fixed Fees**    | **Usage Fees**      |

| Subscription      | Tiers               |
| One-Time Fee      | Volume              |

| Credits           | Revenue Share       |

## Fixed Fees

For fixed fee rates, we offer five kinds of payment models:   

### Subscription Pricing  

Used mainly for charges such as the Platform Fee, the client pays upfront for each calendar month the exact amount.

By default, charges are calculated on a **pro rata** basis according to the number of days client is _active_ on the platform. By default, payments will be calendar-aligned. This can be adjusted in your plan settings by going to **General Terms**, then \*\*Select Billing Method:\*\*Calendar-Aligned Payments Example

In cases where the subscription _is_ calendar-aligned, consider a scenario when a customer subscribes beginning on July 14:

- The first invoice to be generated covers the period between July 14 to July 31 (the final date of the month)
- The next invoice will cover August 1 through August 31 (the full calendar month)
- All future invoices will be generated for full calendar months.

#### Pro Rata Payment Calculation Example

When a subscription starts during the month, the subscription fee will be calculated on a \*\*pro rata (partial) basis \*\*according to the number of days the account has been _active_.

In the above example, the July 14-31 covers 18 days. If the premium plan is \$50/mo, the cost for the first invoice will be calculated like this:

(\$50/31 days) × 18 days = \$29.03

### One-Time Fee 

This is used mostly for one-time fees, for example the **Integration Fee**. Charges are added to the client’s first issued invoice or at day one as separate invoice.

### Yearly Commitment

A total amount that represent the contact total value, usually paid upfront on mutually agreed date  for the entire contract period.

### Credits

A negative line item, a credit is a reduction in the amount owed, often issued as a credit note.

### Refunds

A negative line item, a refund is a return of money to the customer, usually in cash or back to their payment method.

## Usage Fees

### Tier-Based Pricing 

This bills price per unit in a tiered system. The tier is determined by the actual usage in a period. Usage **_accumulation is set to monthly by default._**

<Note>
  **<u>Metering vs. Billing</u>**\
  \
  You can have different usage metering and billing intervals. For example, you can meter monthly _but_ charge for overage _quarterly._
</Note>

### Volume Pricing

Usage accumulation is ‘lifetime’ from the contract start date.  The charges are periodic and are based on the a accumulative volume up until that point.

### Tiered Subscription

For tiered subscriptions, a flat rate fee will apply based on the consumption in a tier for each billing period.  By default, subscriptions will be upfront charges on a _monthly_ basis.

You can add the following enhanced pricing features to tier subscriptions:

- **Auto-upgrade**
- **Discount**
- **Prepay (custom interval)** – Collecting payment at the start of a chosen period (e.g., monthly, quarterly, custom) for the upcoming service

  **Pro rata** (a.k.a. **Proration**) – Charging only for the portion of a billing period used when a plan starts, changes, or ends mid-cycle, typically proportional to days or units.
- **Rollover overage into the next invoice** – Carrying excess usage from one period to be billed on the subsequent invoice instead of the current one

### Usage Products – Advanced Options

**Commitment**

Commitment is the minimum <u>quantity</u> a customer has committed to consume <u>during the plan lifetime</u>. The commitment can be either in ‘Units’ or based on dedicated ‘Amount’ (USD).

### Base amount

Base amounts allow you to set a minimum amount to be charged in cases of zero consumption. This is only applicable for metered or usage-based products.
