# **Pricing — Fixed and Usage Fees**

Vayu supports two general payment models: fixed fees and usage fees. Each model has multiple options, as we will describe below. There are standard or default options baked into many of these plans, which can be adapted based on customer needs. Click on any option to see a more detailed description:

| **Fixed Fees** | **Usage-Based Fees** |
| :------------- | :------------------- |
| Subscription   | Tiered               |
| One-Time Fee   | Volume               |
| Contract Terms | Per Unit             |
| Commission     | Tiered Subscription  |
|                | Revenue Share        |

## **Fixed Fees**

For fixed fee rates, we offer four kinds of payment models:   

### Subscription Pricing

Used mainly for charges such as the Platform Fee, the client pays upfront for each calendar month the exact amount.

By default, charges are calculated on a **pro rata** basis according to the number of days client is _active_ on the platform. By default, payments will be calendar-aligned. This can be adjusted in your plan settings by going to **General Terms**, then Select Billing Method: Calendar-Aligned Payments

#### **_Example_**

In cases where the subscription _is_ calendar-aligned, consider a scenario when a customer subscribes beginning on July 14:

- The first invoice to be generated covers the period between July 14 to July 31 (the final date of the month)
- The next invoice will cover August 1 through August 31 (the full calendar month)
- All future invoices will be generated for full calendar months.

#### **_Pro Rata Payment Calculation Example_**

When a subscription starts during the month, the subscription fee will be calculated on a \*\*pro rata (partial) basis \*\*according to the number of days the account has been _active_.

In the above example, the July 14-31 covers 18 days. If the premium plan is \$50/mo, the cost for the first invoice will be calculated like this:

(\$50/31 days) × 18 days = \$29.03

### One-Time Fee

A single, non-recurring charge applied once to begin using a product.

Click on Modify and the lefthand menu will open.

There, you can add a Product ID (NetSuite or QuickBooks) credits, a product description, or a discount. You can also set payments and a schedule.

Charges are added to the client’s first issued invoice or at day one as separate invoice.

### **Contract Terms**

A total amount that represents the contract’s total value. This might be paid upfront on a mutually agreed date for the entire contract period, or paid in installments at a recurring interval.

To add advanced installments to contract terms, click one of the features of the product as shown below. Select **SCHEDULE**, then **Set advanced installments**.

There, you can define the amount for each installment.

### Commission

Designate a percentage of the total as a commission in your plan.

## **Usage Fees**

### Tier-Based Pricing

This bills price per unit in a tiered system. The tier is determined by the actual usage in a period. Usage **_accumulation is set to monthly by default._**

**When to Use:** Use when unit prices should step down as monthly usage grows.

**<u>Metering vs. Billing</u>**\
You can have different usage metering and billing intervals. For example, you can meter monthly _but_ charge for overage _quarterly._

### **Volume Pricing**

Usage accumulation is ‘lifetime’ from the contract start date. The charges are periodic and are based on the a accumulative volume up until that point.

**_When to Use:_** Best when you prefer stable pricing that moves only after sustained growth

### **Tiered Subscription**

For tiered subscriptions, a flat rate fee will apply based on the consumption in a tier for each billing period. By default, subscriptions will be upfront charges on a _monthly_ basis.

For example, consider these pricing tiers for cloud storage:

| **PRODUCT**   | **OPTION**              | **PRICE**  |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Cloud Storage | Tier A: Up to 50 TB/mo  | \$0.024/GB |
|               | Tier B: Up to 450 TB/mo | \$0.023/GB |
|               | Tier C: Above 450 TB/mo | \$0.022/GB |

You can add the following enhanced pricing features to tier subscriptions:

- **Auto-Upgrade** – When a customer crosses a usage tier into a new tier, that customer is automatically upgraded to the new tier permanently
- **Discount** – A price reduction applied at the line-item or plan level (can be a One-Time Discount or a Recurring Discount)
- **Prepay** – Collecting payment at the start of a chosen period for the upcoming service
- **Pro rata** (a.k.a. **Proration**) – Charging only for the portion of a billing period used when a plan starts, changes, or ends mid-cycle, typically proportional to days or units.
- **Rollover overage into the next invoice** – Carrying excess usage from one period to be billed on the subsequent invoice instead of the current one

When to Use: Predictable monthly usage that can spike

### **Revenue Share**

**When to Use:** Use when fees should scale with your reported revenue rather than units.

## **Usage Products – Advanced Options**

### **Commitment**

Commitment is the minimum <u>quantity</u> a customer has committed to consume <u>during the plan lifetime</u>. The commitment can be either in ‘Units’ or based on dedicated ‘Amount’ (USD).

### **Base amount**

Base amounts allow you to set a minimum amount to be charged in cases of zero consumption. This is only applicable for metered or usage-based products.
