#### Contract Status

- **Active / Inactive**
  An active contract refers to a contract that is live and operational. The platform's automated billing cycle generates invoices based on the contract's defined terms and billing period. Invoices for active contracts will appear in the **Invoices** section. You also have the option to deactivate a contract, which will suspend billing automation, and no further invoices will be issued.Contracts with future start dates are labeled as "Inactive" and will automatically transition to active status once the start date is reached.
- **Terminated** 
  The contract will conclude on the specified end date. Upon termination, no additional invoices will be issued. Terminated contracts cannot be duplicated or turned into Active again. 

#### Contract Edit

Use edit for contract that only started and no invoice had been approved.

**When to use:** when these is a mistake or some wrong pricing definition  and no invoices has been approved or issued to customers

**What to expect** The system will deleted and replace the contract and the invoices with new ones from the given start date.

#### Contract Revision

Revision allows you to edit the commercial terms of a contract and is applicable for the following use cases:

**Renewal with new terms** 

Renewal of contract for a new period with updated pricing terms. 

**Update** **of the current contract** 

Update contract terms and commercial details, including additional products, pricing, and discounts. You can modify the contract terms _retroactively_ or schedule updates for a _future_ date. Invoices will be issued based on the updated terms.

**When to use update contract terms** 
when the contract is process ‘live’ and ‘active’ however, there are new pricing / products that needs to be updated and added to the current contract.

**What to expect**

1. System will Terminate the old contract immediately and will start a new version based on the initial start date but with the new terms.
2. System will re-generate invoices for the selected period. Invoices which are on ‘**Draft**’ and ‘**In** **review**’ will be deleted and **re generated** according to the updated terms.
