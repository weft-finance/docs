## **Usage Fees**

### Tier-Based Pricing

This bills price per unit in a tiered system. The tier is determined by the actual usage in a period. Usage **_accumulation is set to monthly by default._**

**_When to Use:_** Use when unit prices should step down as monthly usage grows.

<Tip>
  Metering vs. Billing\
  \
  You can have different usage metering and billing intervals. For example, you can meter monthly _but_ charge for overage _quarterly._
</Tip>

### **Volume Pricing**

Usage accumulation is ‘lifetime’ from the contract start date. The charges are periodic and are based on the a accumulative volume up until that point.

**_When to Use:_** Best when you prefer stable pricing that moves only after sustained growth

### **Tiered Subscription**

For tiered subscriptions, a flat rate fee will apply based on the consumption in a tier for each billing period. By default, subscriptions will be upfront charges on a _monthly_ basis.

For example, consider these pricing tiers for cloud storage:

| **PRODUCT**   | **OPTION**              | **PRICE**  |
| :------------ | :---------------------- | :--------- |
| Cloud Storage | Tier A: Up to 50 TB/mo  | \$0.024/GB |
|               | Tier B: Up to 450 TB/mo | \$0.023/GB |
|               | Tier C: Above 450 TB/mo | \$0.022/GB |

You can add the following enhanced pricing features to tier subscriptions:

- **Auto-Upgrade** – When a customer crosses a usage tier into a new tier, that customer is automatically upgraded to the new tier permanently
- **Discount** – A price reduction applied at the line-item or plan level (can be a One-Time Discount or a Recurring Discount)
- **Prepay** – Collecting payment at the start of a chosen period for the upcoming service
- **Pro rata** (a.k.a. **Proration**) – Charging only for the portion of a billing period used when a plan starts, changes, or ends mid-cycle, typically proportional to days or units.
- **Rollover overage into the next invoice** – Carrying excess usage from one period to be billed on the subsequent invoice instead of the current one

**_When to Use:_** Predictable monthly usage that can spike

### **Revenue Share**

**When to Use:** Use when fees should scale with your reported revenue rather than units.

## **Usage Products – Advanced Options**

### **Commitment**

Commitment is the minimum <u>quantity</u> a customer has committed to consume <u>during the plan lifetime</u>. The commitment can be either in ‘Units’ or based on dedicated ‘Amount’ (USD).

### **Base amount**

Base amounts allow you to set a minimum amount to be charged in cases of zero consumption. This is only applicable for metered or usage-based products.
