### Ingesting Events

Ingesting events is a feature that allows you to send events to Vayu. Events are used to track user interactions with your products and services.

#### Sending Events

You can send events using the `ingest` method available on the `events` object. This method requires an `IngestEventPayload` object as an argument, which allows you to send events with various attributes such as `name`, `timestamp`, and `properties`.

We currently support payloads up to 50mb in size.


### Example Code

```typescript
import { Vayu, IngestEventPayload } from "vayu-ts/v2";

export async function IngestEvents() {
  const apiKey: string = '{{ YOUR API KEY }}';

  const vayu = new Vayu(apiKey);

  await vayu.login();

  const productEventName = '{{ YOUR EVENT NAME }}';
  const customerAlias = '{{ YOUR CUSTOMER ALIAS }}';
  const eventData = { /* Data */ };
  const eventRef = '{{ UNIQUE EVENT REFERENCE }}';
  const eventTimestamp = new Date().getTime(); // The time the event occurred in Unix time

  const events: IngestEventPayload[] = [
    {
      customerAlias: customerAlias,
      data: eventData,
      eventName: productEventName,
      ref: eventRef,
      timestamp: eventTimestamp,
    },
  ];

  return vayu.events.ingest(events);
}
```
