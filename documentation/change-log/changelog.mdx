<Update label="November 11, 2025" tags={["Reporting", "UI"]}>
  # **MRR Report**

  Vayu has improved its recurring revenue reporting. These reports are viewable in the app, can be downloaded in CSV form and are available by account or customer level. The reports allow for custom fields (which appear by additional column), support contract phases, and can be viewed along with past reports’ MRR data in the Vayu UI.
</Update>

# **Additional Improvements**

You will now see better customer-to-contact linking and data consistency in the Vayu UI.

<Update label="September 23, 2025" tags={["UI", "API", "Reporting", "Billing & Invoicing", "Contracts"]}>
</Update>

This release focused heavily on invoice management, especially currencies and line item editing. Bug fixes and feature enhancements also included a focus on accurate PDF generation.

# **Currencies: Contract and Invoice-Level**

Approved invoices will maintain their original currency and _not auto-switch_ when customer currency settings are changed. For example, if you charged a customer USD in the past, but switched your default to EUR later, that previous invoice will remain in USD.

Additional currency-related updates include:

- **Data Migration:** We added an overridingCurrency field as well as new migration settings for invoice currencies.
- **Dynamic Editing:** Improved line item editing and dynamic currency fields for invoices (UI and API)

  Vayu now lets you create phased contract agreements, where the terms of payment change throughout the life of the contract.
