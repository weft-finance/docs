# Change Log

<Update label="November 25, 2025" tags={["Reporting"]}>
  # ARR/MRR Visualization

  This update has many feature additions for reporting recurring revenue. First, there is a new ARR graph on your homepage dashboard, reporting real-time revenue updates.

  We have enhanced the recurring revenue endpoint to be more accurate on ARR/MRR metrics at both the customer and account levels. Additional features include contract phases in MRR calculation and custom fields for MRR reports.

  ## Other Notable Updates

  - **Billing Engine: **We have just implemented automatic rounding of line items and invoice revenues to pre-configured decimal precision, which you can define in your account settings. This will be consistent across the platform.
  - **Cloning Contracts:** Users can now duplicate previous contracts with pre-filled fields, including the customer and required start date. This will speed up new contract creation.
</Update>

  # Tier Usage Notification

  We have updated Vayu to send an in-app alert when usage passes the last tier. This will let users know to follow up and adjust settings later.

  - A “Select All” option was added to product dropdowns for improved selected item display.
  - Aggregated invoices will default to “In Review.”

  # **MRR Report**

  Vayu has improved its recurring revenue reporting. These reports are viewable in the app, can be downloaded in CSV form and are available by account or customer level. \
  \
  Navigate to **Reports** on the left-side menu, then go to the menu on the right and select **Recurring Revenue Reports \>**.\
  \
  The reports allow for custom fields (which appear by additional column), support contract phases, and can be viewed along with past reports' MRR data in the Vayu UI.

</Update>

<Update label="September 23, 2025" tags={["UI", "API", "Reporting", "Billing & Invoicing", "Contracts"]}>
  This release focused heavily on invoice management, especially currencies and line item editing. Bug fixes and feature enhancements also included a focus on accurate PDF generation.

  # **Currencies: Contract and Invoice-Level**

  Approved invoices will maintain their original currency and _not auto-switch_ when customer currency settings are changed. For example, if you charged a customer USD in the past, but switched your default to EUR later, that previous invoice will remain in USD.

  Additional currency-related updates include:

  - **Data Migration:** We added an overridingCurrency field as well as new migration settings for invoice currencies.
  - **Dynamic Editing:** Improved line item editing and dynamic currency fields for invoices (UI and API)
