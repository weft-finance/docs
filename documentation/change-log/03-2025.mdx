  </Frame>
  The **Customer Overview Page** provides a consolidated view of a customer's **financial status, revenue insights, and key metrics**, streamlining workflows for tracking billing, managing contracts, and analyzing revenue trends. It includes real-time financial analytics, alerts, and quick access to invoices and subscriptions.

  # Hide Line Item

  <Frame>
    ![](//assets/images/customer-overview/hide-line-item.png)
  </Frame>
  Users can now **hide specific usage-based** and **metered line items** from invoices. This feature allows for greater flexibility in invoice presentation by graying out non-essential items without removing them entirely. Hidden items **remain visible** for internal reference but are **excluded from the final invoice** sent to customers.

  # Customer Portal

  <Frame>
    ![ Pn](/assets/images/customer-overview/customer-portal.png)
  </Frame>
  Vayu's new **Customer Portal** offers a secure, hassle-free way for customers to access all their invoices in one place. With a **single-use, one-time access key**, customers can view, track, and download invoices without managing multiple emails or logins. For full details, refer to the **documentation**.

  # Scheduled Products

  **\*Coming Soon\***\
  Set **schedules**  for individual products within a contract with the **Scheduled Products** feature. Instead of following a fixed contract date, you can bill products on different timelines, issue separate invoices, or include them in existing billing cycles—offering flexibility for **complex pricing models, phased deployments, or staggered activations.**

## Streamlined MRR Reports

Reporting UI

### **MRR Report**

Vayu has improved its recurring revenue reporting. These reports are viewable in the app, can be downloaded in CSV form and are available by account or customer level. The reports allow for custom fields (which appear by additional column), support contract phases, and can be viewed along with past reports’ MRR data in the Vayu UI.

You will see better customer-to-contact linking and data consistency in the Vayu UI:

<Update label="September 23, 2025" tags={ UI, API, Reporting, Billing & Invoicing, Contracts}>
  
</Update>

This release focused heavily on invoice management, especially currencies and line item editing. Bug fixes and feature enhancements also included a focus on accurate PDF generation. 

### **Currencies: Contract and Invoice-Level**

Approved invoices will maintain their original currency and _not auto-switch_ when customer currency settings are changed. For example, if you charged a customer USD in the past, but switched your default to EUR later, that previous invoice will remain in USD.

Additional currency-related updates include:

- **Data Migration:** We added an overridingCurrency field as well as new migration settings for invoice currencies.
- **Dynamic Editing:** Improved line item editing and dynamic currency fields for invoices (UI and API)
