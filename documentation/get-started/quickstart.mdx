### Get Started

Getting started with Vayu could not be simpler.
Check out the steps you’ll need to take:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Pricing Plan">
    You can create pricing plans for specific customers or subsidiaries as well as create generic pricing plans to use as templates that can be customized as necessary.

    Any plan can combine whichever types of pricing you need, whether it’s usage-based, commitment fees, tiered pricing, etc. You can also choose the currency you need for each plan. Furthermore, you get to define the start date, duration, and the frequency at which invoices are created and at what intervals.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore Invoices">
    You’ll have real-time insight into your customers’ consumption at any given time, as well as what that means for their billing. Invoices are generated automatically and accurately according to your specifications. Once they’re ready, you can review, modify if desired, and send.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Customers">
    You can add customers directly from data in a CSV file, from syncing via a Salesforce or Hubspot integration, or manually using the quick and simple process in the Vayu platform. You can establish subsidiaries and related entities with ease.

    Once a customer is set up, you can view their current billing and usage status, balance overview, issued and overdue invoices, and more at any time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Data Metering">
    The Vayu platform gives you visibility into your events and data metering.
    You’ll be able to view all the events that have been digested and counted by the platform, download consumption reports, and define products to meter.
