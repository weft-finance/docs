Modern businesses offer a wide variety of pricing options including usage-based pricing, fixed fees, subscription costs, tiered pricing, discounts, promotions, and more. Companies aim to provide pricing that suits their customers' needs, aligns with the products being used, and is sensitive to variations across geographies or subsidiaries.

Vayu's vision is to make embracing total pricing flexibility fast, easy, accurate, and hassle-free, and Vayu provides just that.

Integrating with Vayu is straightforward and takes just a few hours through a simple RESTful API integration. Once integrated, Vayu's platform can receive events of all kinds from your BI, CRM, and ERP systems. Any event, from any source, can be a billable event. How it's billed is entirely up to you and can be configured using Vayu's intuitive low-code/no-code interface, ensuring that commercial terms from diverse platforms are accurately reflected in your invoices.

Setting up pricing plans, templates, and contracts for specific customers can be done quickly and easily using the manual option within the Vayu platform. Alternatively, you can simply pull this data from your existing systems.

Once a billing plan is set up, all invoices are generated automatically at the designated times. You'll gain real-time insights into customer usage and its effect on billing, with the flexibility to make adjustments at any time.

### Architecture Principles
Vayu is designed to provide companies with complete autonomy over their pricing and billing.

Developer or data resources are only required for the initial integration. After that, product and sales teams can freely manage pricing models, while finance teams have the ability to bill customers accurately and effortlessly, regardless of the complexity of the data or pricing model.

### What Developers Need to Know
The Vayu API is focused and direct: it is for logging in and for sending events. It takes two lines of code for your company to start being able to bill for metered events at scale.
