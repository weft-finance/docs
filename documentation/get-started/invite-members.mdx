Team collaboration in Vayu is managed through user invitations and role-based access control. You can invite members to your account and assign them specific roles that determine their permissions and access levels.

## User roles

Vayu offers three distinct user roles, each with different levels of access and permissions:

### Admin

Admins have full access to all features and settings in Vayu. This role is designed for account owners and senior team members who need complete control.

**Permissions include:**
- Full access to invoices, customers, plans, and pricing
- User management (invite, update, and remove users)
- Integration configuration and management
- Account settings and configuration
- Reports and analytics
- Data metering and products
- Revenue tracking and credit ledger management
- Phase labels and pricing templates

### Controller

Controllers have comprehensive access to financial and operational features but limited user management capabilities. This role is ideal for finance teams and operations managers.

**Permissions include:**
- Full access to invoices, customers, plans, and pricing
- Integration configuration and management
- Reports and analytics
- Data metering and products
- Account configuration
- View-only access to users
- Revenue tracking and credit ledger management
- View-only access to phase labels and pricing templates

### Developer

Developers have focused access to technical features and data management. This role is designed for engineering teams working with usage data and integrations.

**Permissions include:**
- Full access to data metering and measurements
- Full access to meters and products
- View events and usage data
- View-only access to phase labels and pricing templates
- Job management

## How to invite members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to settings">
    Sign into Vayu and click **Settings** in the lefthand menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Go to members tab">
    Select the **Members** tab to view your team and pending invitations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter member details">
    In the "Invite a new member" section:
    - Enter the email address of the person you want to invite
    - Select their role from the dropdown (Admin, Controller, or Developer)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send invitation">
    Click the **Invite** button to send the invitation email.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The invited user will receive an email with instructions to join your Vayu account. Once they accept the invitation and complete registration, they'll appear in your Members list with the assigned role.

## Managing invitations

### View pending invitations

All pending invitations are displayed in the Invitations table on the Members tab. You can see:
- Email address of the invited user
- Assigned role
- Invitation status
- Date sent

### Cancel invitations

If you need to revoke an invitation before it's accepted, you can cancel it from the Invitations table. The invitation link will no longer be valid.

<Note>
Only users with Admin role can invite new members and manage user permissions.
</Note>

## Managing existing members

Once members have joined your account, you can:
- **Update roles** – Change a member's role to adjust their permissions
- **Remove users** – Remove members from your account (Admin only)
- **View activity** – See which members are active in your account

  <Accordion title="Review permissions regularly">
    Periodically review your team members and their assigned roles to ensure access levels remain appropriate.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use email verification">
    Always verify email addresses before sending invitations to prevent unauthorized access.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Limit Admin access">
    Only assign the Admin role to trusted team members who need full account control.
