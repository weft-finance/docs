# Overview

Vayu specializes in unifying contract commercials and usage data into a single revenue management platform. Oracle’s NetSuite platform offers a powerful way for businesses to handle key financial and operational tasks, including accounting and financial management. Integrating the two platforms ensures that your billing and revenue information is fully up to date and aligned at all times, no matter where you’re accessing it. 

Vayu integrates smoothly and swiftly with Netsuite, offering robust two-way synchronization for your billing and revenue workflows. Not only do you achieve data consistency across platforms, you can also seamlessly automate critical finance operations.

## Capabilities

To enable precise syncing, Vayu uses NetSuite attributes defined at the client/account level, including:

- **Subsidiaries**- Ensures transactions are correctly tagged to the appropriate legal entity in NetSuite.
- **Accounts Receivable** - Sync aligns with the customer’s receivable account setup in NetSuite, ensuring accurate GL posting.
- **Product ERP Mappings** - Products and pricing in Vayu are matched to NetSuite items using ERP codes, classifications, and other identifiers.

In other words, the Vayu configurations will precisely match and mirror your NetSuite setup, ensuring the smooth flow of data between Vayu and NetSuite and providing the framework for reliable reporting and insights.

### Operations

Overall, these are the operations that Vayu’s NetSuite integration supports:

- **Push/Pull** — Across several categories and their attributes, data can be pushed from Vayu to NetSuite, or pulled from NetSuite to Vayu
- **Create/Update** — Users can create new records in Vayu that will be pushed to NetSuite
- **Reconciliation** —Mismatches are noted and displayed to be fixed
- **Scheduled Sync** — Attributes are periodically updated from Vayu

## Prerequisites & Permissions

You will need the following to get started:

1. NetSuite account
2. Vayu account
3. Permissions and Admin support

## Connection & Setup

To launch initial setup and integrations, please contact the Vayu support team.

## Configurations

Set up configurations by clicking on NetSuite on the integration page. A panel with various settings will open to the right side of the page:

### Products

Choose from a dropdown which product you are configuring. For each product, you will be able to configure attributes separately.

### Customers

Here, choose if you want your customer lists to automatically export to your NetSuite account, or if you want to maintain full control and go with manual matching.

We recommend turning on automatic export by selecting ⦿ **Export customers automatically (recommended)**.

### Invoices

There are two configurations for invoices.

First, decide if you want automatic syncing once invoices are approved.

Upon integration, Vayu aggregates metered events and applies pricing rules (fixed, usage-based, or hybrid). The platform generates draft invoices automatically, visible under the customer’s [**Invoices**](https://guide.withvayu.com/documentation/guides/invoices/real-time-invoice) tab:

After approval, invoices are pushed to NetSuite where they inherit all GL and subsidiary attributes from Vayu. NetSuite handles downstream accounting and payment status updates, which Vayu can read back for reconciliation.

_Secondly_, choose which invoice number you want to use as your primary, either the auto-generated NetSuite number or override that number with Vayu's invoice number.

To allow Vayu to override the NetSuite number, enter your NetSuite settings. Go to **Setup**, then Company, then **Auto-Generated Numbers**, then **Document Numbers**. Go to the Invoice row and check **Allow Override**, then hit **Save**.

> While [<u>NetSuite warns</u>](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/bridgehead_4340447524.html) that its next automatic number generation will then follow the higher of the number it generated or the one manually entered, this should not be an issue as the Allow Override setting will let Vayu automatically input its own numbers.

### Credit Memos

Finally, choose whether or not you want to automatically sync credit memos when you create a new credit ledger.

## Field Mappings & Attribution

### How Contracts Sync

When a deal is marked _Closed–Won_ in a CRM (e.g., Salesforce or HubSpot), Vayu automatically creates the customer and contract record.

Contract details—start/end dates, product mix, payment provider, and pricing tiers—are created in Vayu for finance team to review and activate.

The integration ensures that each contract’s commercial terms are reflected in NetSuite sales orders and invoices.

### Approval Workflows

Every invoice has an approval stage before it is synced to NetSuite. Users with proper permissions can modify line items, discounts, quantities, and approve/reject invoices.

Once approved, invoices are automatically pushed to NetSuite, updating the **Invoice Activity Log** with timestamps for:

- “Written to NetSuite”
- “Approved”
- “Paid”

## Reconciliation

### How Data Flows Back into ERP/CRM

NetSuite updates (payment status, AR changes, credit memos) are pulled into Vayu for real-time visibility.

These updates refresh dashboards, contract summaries, and invoice activity views.

### Logs and Activity Tracking

Each integration maintains an **Activity Log** showing:

- When an invoice or order was created, synced, or modified.
- When payments or credits were applied in NetSuite.
- Any sync or validation errors encountered.
- The log is searchable and filterable by customer, object type, or date.
