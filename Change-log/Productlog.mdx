  # Hide Line Item

  </Frame>
  Users can now **hide specific usage-based** and **metered line items** from invoices. This feature allows for greater flexibility in invoice presentation by graying out non-essential items without removing them entirely. Hidden items **remain visible** for internal reference but are **excluded from the final invoice** sent to customers.

  # Customer Overview Page

  </Frame>
  The **Customer Overview Page** provides a consolidated view of a customer's **financial status, revenue insights, and key metrics**, streamlining workflows for tracking billing, managing contracts, and analyzing revenue trends. It includes real-time financial analytics, alerts, and quick access to invoices and subscriptions.

  For full details, refer to the **documentation**.

  # Customer Portal

  Vayu's new **Customer Portal** offers a secure, hassle-free way for customers to access all their invoices in one place. With a **single-use, one-time access key**, customers can view, track, and download invoices without managing multiple emails or logins.

  # Custom Billing Schedules

  ![Favicon Pn](/assets/favicon.png)

  Set **custom billing schedules** for individual products within a contract with the **Scheduled Products** feature. Instead of following a fixed contract date, you can bill products on different timelines, issue separate invoices, or include them in existing billing cyclesâ€”offering flexibility for **complex pricing models, phased deployments, or staggered activations.**
